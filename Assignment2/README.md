The program contains two files one for the server and one for the client. To run the program follow these steps

1.Compile the server so that the client can send its data. Compile Server2.c file by using the comand “gcc -o Server Server2.c”   (if this command throws error then use option -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 to compile your code)
 
2. The next step is to open another terminal and then compile the client by running the command: “gcc -o Client Client2.c" (if this command throws error then use option -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 to compile your code)

3.Now we need to execute the server first by using the command "./Server"

4.Similarly we need to also run the client and begin transmitting packets by using the command "./Client"

The program has now run successfully.
