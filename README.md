Computer Network Coding Assignment

This project focuses on client-server communication using the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The objective is to demonstrate how UDP packets are transmitted and received, as well as the processing performed on these packets. By completing this assignment, you'll gain a better understanding of how UDP-based communication works, particularly in handling connectionless protocols where packet delivery is not guaranteed.

Key goals:

1. Implement a client-server model using UDP.
2. Show how data is encapsulated in UDP packets, transmitted, and received.
3. Process the received packets to complete specific tasks on the server side.
